\section{Production planning problem in extruders}
\label{sec:1}

In the plastic bags manufacturing process, extrusion is the most important stage since it is the main responsible for products fabrication. This stage begins with the insertion of resins into a kind of funnel coupled to the machine. Such material may be polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE) or a mixture of both. Also, the source of the polyethylene resins can be either virgin or recycled material. Next, pigments are added to the resins according to the desired color for the plastic bags being manufactured. The added material (resins and pigments) is then heated and then passes through an air cylinder, receiving the shape of a balloon. Such a balloon rises along the machine while the material cools down gaining more resistance. After, the material passes through two other cylinders forming the bobbins of plastic bags. In the first cylinder, a single bobbin has the width defined by the machine
settings. In the second cylinder, cutting is performed, dividing the single bobbin into a set of bobbins narrower, wich widths are defined according to the specifications of the desired bags. After the extrusion stage, the plastic bags bobbins will be printed (if necessary) and then cut out, forming the lots (bobbins) of plastic bags that will be sent to inventory section. As can be seen above, one of the important issues that must
be dealt with when planning the daily plastic bags production is to determine which models of bags should be processed in each production batch of each extruder. This question becomes complex since the company applies something like a build-to-order strategy and wants to make the production plan to follow the sales schedule whenever possible. So, the proposed solution must minimize the unwanted storage cost without, however, allowing delivery delays. Since the company also has factory outlets for which overproduction is usually directed, some inventory flexibility is allowed in order to avoid machines idleness. Also, since each batch consists of a set of products of the same material and colored with the same pigments, the determination of the set of products that
will be processed together must be made taking into account restrictions related to both the material and the color. One should also consider the machine capacity constraints, such as those related to cylinders width and to the daily time limit assigned to operation of each extruder. The main features of this problem are specified below:

Planning

\begin{item}
\end{itenization}
• The planning horizon is divided into equal lenth time-
periods. Each time period represents a working day.
• Once producted, product lots are stored. The inventory
level is updated at the end of each period time. Unit
invetory cost [R\$] are know and fixed. The inventory cost
per product is direct related to its storage time.
• Product demands [g] for each time period are know and
given in advance. Product lots sold are delivered at the
end of each time period. Unitary contribution of products
[R\$] are know and fixed.
• In order to ensure the proper operation of the factory ou-
tlets, they must maintain adequate level of some products
in their own inventory. In this case, the factory outlets will
be understood as common customers and those needs will
be accounted for each product demand determination.
• With respect to the factory outlets extra demand, this
is restrained by two factors: 1) total space available in
stores for storage of these products; and 2) the limitation
related to the sales capacity of the extra quantity for each
product.
• Also, there is a maximum limit for quantities in stock per
time period of each produc in factory, defined based on
the total space destined for the storage of the products.
Balancing
• A production batch consists of a set of bobbins (lots)
of plastic bags, with the same color, material and the
same total length, processed simultaneously in the same
extruder.
• The total length of bobbins is defined according to the
start time and the end time of the batch processing.
• The sum of the widths of the bobbins processed in the
same batch can not exceed the width of the extruder
cylinder.
• The choice of products that will form a batch must be
made so that the production is as close as possible to
sales schedule.
